## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{I am interested in the crowdfunding projects as a fundamentally liberating idea of people (instead of, for example, investors) directly funding the products they want to use. Therefore, I want to explore the factors which lead to the project being successful. I am particularly interested in the columns “category” and “main_category”, since they will help analyse what type of projects users are most willing to pay for. Moreover, here I can also gain an insight about the shifts of tastes happening in society, by tracking which categories had biggest percentages of success (“state” column ) in different years or time periods. Moreover, the columns “goal” and “pledged” will provide a lot of numerical data, detailing the amount of money successful projects usually ask for. They will also provide a valuable insight into what categories (and at what time of the year) tend to collect the biggest amounts of money. In general, I am interested in working with this dataset because Kickstarter (and other crowdfunding websites) is a unique marketplace there sellers receive funding directly from their future customers, and with this dataset I hope to find out what kind of patterns rules over this marketplace.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{My dataset “ks-projects-201801.csv” contains the information about all projects posted to Kickstarter website from 2009 to 2018. Kickstarter ( https://www.kickstarter.com ) is a web service created for crowdfunding, so the dataset can help understand which projects tend to be successful at receiving crowdfunding, and that decisions can one make to increase his or her chances of succeeding at crowdfunding. The data was collected by a user who is interested in exploring that topic. The data was retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects?select=ks-projects-201801.csv 
The data was collected using website logs. The author collected and shared this dataset to let people explore the relationship between certain characteristic of a project (deadline time, category, country of origin) and its success (or failure). The dataset contains a lot of interesting columns, which will help clarify how the success of a project is related to the country the start-up is from, to the amount of money it demands, to the category of the project, and to the deadline its authors set.
